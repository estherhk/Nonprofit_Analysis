# Nonprofit_Analysis
Use Neural Network model with TensorFlow to analyze nonprofit organizations

## Project Overview
Build a machine learning model to predict the success of a venture by AlphabetSoup.  The trained model will be used to determine the future decisions of the company. There are more than 34,000 organizations that will be determined if they will receive any future funding from Alphabet Soup based on their possibility of success.

## Neural Network Explanation
1. How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?


2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


3. If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
Another model to be used for this classification
