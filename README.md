## Neural Network Explanation
1. How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?


2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


3. If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
Another model to be used for this classification
